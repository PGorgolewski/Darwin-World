# Darwin World JAVA project
Project aim is to simulate the evolution of animals on two maps (one with walls at the ends and second without)

## Description
Simulation consists of days during which those actions are performed:
* Delete dead animals from map
* Move each animal
* Eat 
* Create new animals 
* Add new plants to map

For the starters there are some (we are giving this number) starting animals and 0 plants.

After stopping simulation it is possible to:
- Show dominant genotype (animals change colors to red)
- Start observing an animal (animal change color to purple and statistics appear betwwen map and plots)
- Save stats to .csv file
- Stop observing

## Technology
* Java 15
* JavaFX 17
* Gradle 7.1

## Running
Starting class name is "World" and it is located in "darwin" package

## Background
The project was implemented for the subject `Object-oriented programming` during the third term of studies in the field of Computer Science at the AGH University of Science Technology
